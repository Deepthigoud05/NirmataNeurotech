          Skin conditions affect over <b>1.9 billion people globally</b>, ranking
          as the <b>4th leading cause of non-fatal disease burden</b> worldwide
          PMC. In India, the prevalence of dermatological disorders ranges from{" "}
          <b>6.3% to 11.2% of the general population</b>, with{" "}
          <b>about 32.4% reporting sensitive or very sensitive skin</b>â€”
          extrapolated to approximately 400 million people PMCFrontiers.

        <p>
          Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on{" "}
          <b>visual inspection and patient history</b>, often missing root causes
          like hydration, oil imbalance, stress, or sleep quality. These delays
          can worsen outcomes and strain both healthcare systems and personal
          well-being.

              <h2>Accurate Skin Diagnosis</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Global:</strong> Skin analysis often misses the link between internal factors (stress, hydration, sleep) and external influences (UV, pollution, diet). Most solutions lack multimodal integration and face data trust & privacy challenges in healthcare.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>India:</strong> With 400M+ people affected by skin issues, diagnosis is made harder by pollution, UV exposure, and lifestyle stress. Existing tools are cosmetic-focused, single-parameter, and adoption is slowed by privacy and infrastructure gaps.
